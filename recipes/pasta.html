    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 eggplant, diced into 1/2-inch squares</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 zucchini, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>4 mushrooms, chopped</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (26 ounce) jar plain tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, diced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried marjoram, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Cook eggplant in the boiling water until mostly tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.        </li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute zucchini and garlic until zucchini starts to soften, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes. Add eggplant; saute until browned, about 2 minutes.        </li>
        <li>Heat remaining olive oil in another saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute onion until golden, about 4 minutes. Add tomato sauce, diced tomato, basil, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and bring sauce to just a boil.        </li>
        <li>Pour wine into the zucchini mixture; reduce heat and simmer until liquid is nearly gone, about 6 minutes. Add the tomato sauce; mix well.        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).        </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farfalle pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.        </li>
    </ol>
